	abstract = {Resolution-based provers for multimodal normal logics require pruning of the search space for a proof to ameliorate the inherent intractability of the satisfiability problem for such logics. We present a clausal modal-layered hyper-resolution calculus for the basic multimodal logic, which divides the clause set according to the modal level at which clauses occur to reduce the number of possible inferences. We show that the calculus is complete for the logics being considered. We also show that the calculus can be combined with other strategies. In particular, we discuss the completeness of combining modal layering with negative and ordered resolution and provide experimental results comparing the different refinements.},

The prover implements a resolution-based calculus for both local and global reasoning. The user can choose different normal forms, refinements of the basic resolution calculus, and strategies. We describe these options in detail and discuss their implications. We provide experiments comparing some of these options and comparing the prover with other provers for this logic.},

	abstract = {A lot of methods have been proposed – and sometimes implemented – for proof search in the propositional modal logics K, KT, and S4. It is difficult to compare the usefulness of these methods in practice, since in most cases no or only a few execution times have been published. We try to improve this unsatisfactory situation by presenting a set of benchmark formulas. Note that we do not just list formulas, but give a method that allows us to compare different provers today and in the future. As a starting point we give the results we obtained when we applied this benchmark method to the Logics Workbench (LWB). We hope that the discussion of postulates concerning ATP benchmark helps to obtain improved benchmark methods for other logics, too.},

	abstract = {With the advent of the Semantic Web and the technologies for its realization, the possibilities for applying ontologies as a means to define the information and knowledge semantics become more and more accepted in different domains. The nature of requirements engineering involves capturing knowledge from diverse sources, including many stakeholders with their own interests and points of view. There are, therefore, many potential uses of ontologies in Requirements Engineering (RE). The purpose of this paper is to comprehensively review and present these uses. The main contribution is the classification of approaches that include ontologies within RE, with the aim of clarifying the way in which traditional RE techniques can benefit from them. Furthermore, future trends are identified.},

	abstract = {We show that the terminological logic ACC comprising Boolean operations on concepts and value restrictions is a notational variant of the propositional modal logic K(m)- To demonstrate the utility of the correspondence, we give two of its immediate by-products, Namely, we axiomatize ACC and give a simple proof that subsumption in ACC is PSPACE-complete, replacing the original six-page one.Furthermore, we consider an extension of ACC additionally containing both the identity role and the composition, union, transitive-reflexive closure, range restriction, and inverse of roles. It turns out that this language, called TSL, is a notational variant of the propositional dynamic logic converse-PDL. Using this correspondence, we prove that it suffices to consider finite TSL-models, show that TSL-subsumption is decidable, and obtain an axiomatization of TSL By discovering that features correspond to deterministic programs in dynamic logic, we show that adding them to TSC preserves decidability, although violates its finite model property. Additionally, we describe an algorithm for deciding the coherence of inverse-free TSC-concepts with features. Finally, we prove that universal implications can be expressed within TSC.},
