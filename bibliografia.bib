	abstract = {Resolution-based provers for multimodal normal logics require pruning of the search space for a proof to ameliorate the inherent intractability of the satisfiability problem for such logics. We present a clausal modal-layered hyper-resolution calculus for the basic multimodal logic, which divides the clause set according to the modal level at which clauses occur to reduce the number of possible inferences. We show that the calculus is complete for the logics being considered. We also show that the calculus can be combined with other strategies. In particular, we discuss the completeness of combining modal layering with negative and ordered resolution and provide experimental results comparing the different refinements.},
