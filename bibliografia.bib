	abstract = {Resolution-based provers for multimodal normal logics require pruning of the search space for a proof to ameliorate the inherent intractability of the satisfiability problem for such logics. We present a clausal modal-layered hyper-resolution calculus for the basic multimodal logic, which divides the clause set according to the modal level at which clauses occur to reduce the number of possible inferences. We show that the calculus is complete for the logics being considered. We also show that the calculus can be combined with other strategies. In particular, we discuss the completeness of combining modal layering with negative and ordered resolution and provide experimental results comparing the different refinements.},

	abstract = {A lot of methods have been proposed – and sometimes implemented – for proof search in the propositional modal logics K, KT, and S4. It is difficult to compare the usefulness of these methods in practice, since in most cases no or only a few execution times have been published. We try to improve this unsatisfactory situation by presenting a set of benchmark formulas. Note that we do not just list formulas, but give a method that allows us to compare different provers today and in the future. As a starting point we give the results we obtained when we applied this benchmark method to the Logics Workbench (LWB). We hope that the discussion of postulates concerning ATP benchmark helps to obtain improved benchmark methods for other logics, too.},
